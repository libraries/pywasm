# WebAssembly provides only four basic value types. These are integers and IEEE 754-2019 numbers, each in 32 and 64 bit
# width. 32 bit integers also serve as Booleans and as memory addresses. The usual operations on these types are
# available, including the full matrix of conversions between them. There is no distinction between signed and unsigned
# integer types. Instead, integers are interpreted by respective operations as either unsigned or signed in twoâ€™s
# complement representation.
